Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 15 DEX save or be knocked prone and buried under the rubble. A buried creature is restrained and unable to breathe or stand up. A creature, including the buried creature, can take its action to free the buried creature by succeeding on a DC 15 STR check while within reach of the buried creature.\\n- **Swirling Ash.** Searing ash blasts a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. Each creature within 30 feet of that point must make a DC 15 CON save. On a failure, a creature takes 10 (3d6) fire damage and is blinded until the end of its next turn. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn't blinded. The ash ignites flammable objects within 30 feet of that point that aren't being worn or carried.\\n- **Conflagrate.** One creature the dragon can see within 120 feet of it becomes tethered to the Elemental Plane of Fire. The target must succeed on a DC 15 CHA save or be burned for 1 minute. While burned, the target takes 7 (2d6) fire damage at the start of each of its turns.

Such creatures have disadvantage on CHA checks, except CHA (Intimidation), and Beasts in the area that aren't domesticated are more aggressive than normal.\\n- **Unnatural Heat.** Within 1 mile of the red dragon's lair, temperatures are unnaturally high. Vegetation in the area withers and eventually crumbles to dust. Creatures in the area require twice as much water as normal each day to survive, and each creature in the area must succeed on a DC 10 CON save every hour it remains in the area or suffer one level of exhaustion. Creatures that are resistant or immune to fire damage are unaffected by this regional effect.\\nIf the dragon dies, these effects fade in 1d10 days.\"}]",
