A creature so afflicted must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw after every long rest.

This reduction can't be removed until the victim recovers from darakhul fever, and even then only by greater restoration or similar magic. The victim recovers from the disease by making successful saving throws on two consecutive days. Greater restoration cures the disease; lesser restoration allows the victim to make the daily Constitution check with advantage. Primarily spread among humanoids, the disease can affect ogres, and therefore other giants may be susceptible. If the infected creature dies while infected with darakhul fever, roll 1d20, add the character's current Constitution modifier, and find the result on the Adjustment Table to determine what undead form the victim's body rises in.
