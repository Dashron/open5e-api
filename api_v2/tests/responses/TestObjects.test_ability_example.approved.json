    "desc": "Dexterity measures agility, reflexes, and balance.\r\n\r\n### Dexterity Checks\r\n\r\nA Dexterity check can model any attempt to move nimbly, quickly, or quietly, or to keep from falling on tricky footing. The Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Dexterity checks.\r\n\r\n**Acrobatics.** Your Dexterity (Acrobatics) check covers your attempt to stay on your feet in a tricky situation, such as when you\u2019re trying to run across a sheet of ice, balance on a tightrope, or stay upright on a rocking ship\u2019s deck. The GM might also call for a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to see if you can perform acrobatic stunts, including dives, rolls, somersaults, and flips. \r\n**Sleight of Hand.** Whenever you attempt an act of legerdemain or manual trickery, such as planting something on someone else or concealing an object on your person, make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. The GM might also call for a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to determine whether you can lift a coin purse off another person or slip something out of another person\u2019s pocket.\r\n**Stealth.** Make a Dexterity (Stealth) check when you attempt to conceal yourself from enemies, slink past guards, slip away without being noticed, or sneak up on someone without being seen or heard. \r\n**Other Dexterity Checks.** The GM might call for a Dexterity check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:\r\n* Control a heavily laden cart on a steep descent\r\n* Steer a chariot around a tight turn\r\n* Pick a lock\r\n* Disable a trap\r\n* Securely tie up a prisoner\r\n* Wriggle free of bonds\r\n* Play a stringed instrument\r\n* Craft a small or detailed object\r\n\r\n### Attack Rolls and Damage\r\nYou add your Dexterity modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a ranged weapon, such as a sling or a longbow. You can also add your Dexterity modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a melee weapon that has the finesse property, such as a dagger or a rapier.\r\n\r\n### Armor Class\r\nDepending on the armor you wear, you might add some or all of your Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class.\r\n\r\n### Initiative\r\nAt the beginning of every combat, you roll initiative by making a Dexterity check. Initiative determines the order of creatures\u2019 turns in combat.",
