    "desc": "This blade appears to be a beautiful cruciform sword of shining silver, inlaid with sparkling rubies.\nYou gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. It has the following properties.\n\n##### Corrosive Submission\nWhen you hit a humanoid with this weapon, you may force it to take an additional 3d6 acid damage and it must make a DC 14 Charisma saving throw. On a failure, the creature is charmed by you for up to 1 hour. If you attack the creature again while charmed, the acid damage increases to 10d6 and the charm ends. It cannot be charmed again for 24 hours after the charm is ended in this way.\n\n##### Hidden Nature\nThe acid damage dealt by this greatsword appears to be radiant damage; Any creature who is successfully charmed by it is under the illusion that the damage to it was merely an admonishing jostle. A true seeing spell or similar reveals that this sword is actually a rusted, pitted blade dripping with acid.\n\n##### Sentience\nThe Decadent End is a sentient evil weapon with an Intelligence of 14, a Wisdom of 12, and a Charisma of 18. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet. The weapon can speak, read, and understand Common, and can communicate with its wielder telepathically. Those who hold it hear the wise voice of a sorrowful king, beckoning the user to seize their destiny.\n\n##### Personality\nThe Decadent End slowly attempts to sway the character into sowing chaos, telling lies about great leaders, claiming that they are corrupt and must be overthrown. The voice of this blade is actually a demon prince, speaking from his Abyssal prison. Should the wielder continue to disobey the urges of the weapon for an extended period of time, it can attempt to charm the wielder. They must make a Charisma saving throw (DC 14). On a success, they are immune to the sword’s charm for 24 hours. Upon a failure, they become charmed by the sword for 24 hours. During this time, the sword can force the character to take an action of its choice once an hour, the wielder accepting this action as their own will. Should the chosen action lead to the harm of a non-hostile creature or ally, the charm immediately breaks.",
